# Dotfile backups
As I've been working on different machines, I realized a need for a consistent environment.
As a result, my local machine, home server, and other machines end up with different configurations.
This is my rough attempt at ensuring I don't lose any configurations I may have.

## Usage
Currently this script only supports backing up the dotfiles. Future work will improve the robustness
of this script.

`python3 backup.py`

To setup on a new machine, first run the following command: `python3 setup.py`
